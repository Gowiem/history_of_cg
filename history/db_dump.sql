                    The animation was provided by Pacific Data Images (PDI). The animators at PDI worked closely with
                    the normal animators on The Simpsons and worked hard not to "reinvent the character[s]".
                    The Simpsons animators storyboarded the segments and showed the PDI animators how they would have
                    handled the scenes.
                    While designing the 3D model of Bart, the animators did not know how they would show Bart''s hair.
                    However, they realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a
                    model. One of the most difficult parts for the PDI animators was to make Homer and Bart move
                    properly without making them look robotic.
                    One of the key shots in the segment was where Homer steps into the 3D world and his design
                    transitions into 3D. Bill Oakley considers the shot the "money shot" and had a difficult
                    time communicating his idea to the animators.

                    the player to look up and down. Its design combines simulation elements with concepts from earlier
                    CRPGs, including Wizardry and Dungeon Master; this led the game''s designers to label it as a "dungeon
                    simulation". As such, the game is non-linear and allows for emergent gameplay.

                    miniature and practical effects approach.
                    Instead of returning to NY and Magi, Bo stayed in LA and originally formed his company as Gehring
                    Aviation in 1977. Based on his experience with computer controlled machine tools, he sought to
                    capitalize on the new need for computer driven motion control cameras for visual effects work.

                    realistic specular highlights.

                    Phong''s work at the University of Utah, and Blinn''s desire to represent a more accurate specular
                    lighting model. Blinn then spent many weeks researching extensively at the University library,
                    discovering many papers dating back to the 1920s by an "optical illumination societyâ€ and
                    more recent work was done by Torrance and Sparrow at the University of Minnesota. However all these
                    theories were fairly cumbersome to describe and not directly related to CG. What Blinn did was to
                    codify the theory into a practical light reflection model that was both physically based and
                    accurate.
                    The Blinn shading model was later expanded upon by Ken Torrance and Rob Cook at the University of
                    Cornell.

                    unlike raytracing in that no secondary rays are (or can be) generated due to the nature of the

                    film plotter - there was no disk space to store rendered images as files. Each frame would take
                    30-90 minutes to render and 10 minutes to plot. Color consistency isn''t guaranteed across film baths
                    so if we missed or gashed a frame, we started over after we''d got the film back from the labs. Our

                    could start a render on that one. My 8 second sting took a week to render. The air conditioner was

                    three 8bit buffers could be combined to create the first RGB color frame buffer ever! Sometime later
                    Alex not only delivered the two additional frame buffers, but an additional 3, which gave the CGL

                    computer-machine." David DiFrancesco was the hardware guy, Loren Carpenter was the software
                    guy, and Alvy Ray Smith managed the project. When it came time to write up a formal proposal about
                    the new device, it seemed appropriate to come up with a catchy name for the middle component of the
                    system, the computer that did the image processing between the scanning and the filming.
                    One night over dinner (at Franks Country Garden restaurant in Bel Marin Keys, California), four men
                    got around to discussing the topic of a name. Present were Rodney Stock (a hardware consultant), Jim
                    Blinn (who worked at Lucas for a short time), Loren Carpenter, and Alvy Ray Smith. Because the hope
                    was for this clever device to actually "make pictures," the name Picture Maker was
                    suggested. This quickly was rejected in favor of Alvy''s suggested contraction of Pixer. Loren then
                    made the suggestion to change it to Pixar (it had a nicer ring to it), and the rest is history.
                    Loren relates that there occasionally are some attempts to put a greater meaning to the word after

                    image-processing market, and Disney made a significant partnership with Pixar to develop the
                    graphics end of what would eventually become Disney''s CAPS system. Roy Disney himself wanted to get
                    his company back into feature animation in the right way, and this was seen (wisely) as an
                    investment in the future technology of 2D animation production.
                    Ed Catmull and Pixar soon realized, however, that the 2D image-processing power of the Image
                    Computer was not a moneymaker. They felt its days were numbered because of the ever increasing power
                    and low cost of new general-purpose PCs. Ed chose, however, not to drop the hardware development
                    business right away, mainly because the CAPS deal with Disney was entirely based on the Pixar Image
                    Computer, and he did not want to leave them high and dry. Ed also knew it was only a matter of a
                    time before they could port the CAPS development to the new SGI platform; it was just a matter of
                    waiting it out while they continued to lose money. Just then, Ed received a call from one of their
                    chief competitors in the image-processing market, a company called Vicom. Vicom was taking the
                    position that to make that market more successful, all the competitors should join forces with one
                    product. "Would Pixar be willing to sell their hardware outright to Vicom?" Ed: "Let

                    Imaging Computer hardware business to Vicom for $2 million, hoping that they could keep it as a
                    viable product just long enough for the Disney CAPS system to transition over to SGI, which is

                    management. SGD''s Japanese distributor (Nichimen) had a thriving business based on the SGD product
                    line of videographics hardware and the animation and rendering software. They couldn''t afford to see
                    us get blown away lest they be left without a source of supply. So they started buying up an
                    insurance policy. They made Symbolics some offers it couldn''t refuse given its poor financial
                    health.
                    In a sequence of financial transactions, Nichimen bought rights to certain hardware technologies.
                    They also started picking up the payroll for SGD employees in exchange for certain worldwide
                    distribution rights. In the end, we had the people but Nichimen ended up owning most of our
                    hard-earned technology.
                    We already had begun looking at how to port these tools off of Symbolics workstation platforms. SGI
                    became the porting target. By 1991, we were well into the rewrite and port, but Symbolics needed to
                    pull the plug on us.
                    I worked out a pretty amazing salvage deal with our old friends at Triple-I. I negotiated a contract
                    where I could take all of SGD''s key employees back to the employ of Triple-I but under a funding
                    arrangement with Nichimen. Nichimen got their security blanket, and the employees kept their jobs.
                    (A blanket layoff and the entire extermination of SGD were the alternatives at the time.)
                    At Triple-I, we proceeded to port all the SGD products to SGI machines, but things started going
                    sour there, too.
                    We spun out of Triple-I and started yet another new company (with Nichimen seed funding) called Del
                    Rey Graphics. Del Ray was co-founded by Al Fenaughty, President and CEO of Triple-I, along with Jack
                    Holloway, one of the Foonly designers at Triple-I. But that didn''t work due to a hostile takeover by
                    Nichimen. My partners and I ended up selling the whole thing to Nichimen and what is left of this
                    very long thread is now called Nichimen Graphics."

                    Engineering South building. In the evenings, imagesâ€”manipulated using the GRASS system and analog
                    processorâ€”were projected onto large video screens and shown on monitors to the accompaniment of
                    live music.
                    "Real time," with respect to these performances, meant that the images changed
                    instantaneously as the controls were manipulated. In effect, the performers "played" both
                    musical instruments and visuals. The performances were improvisational in a variety of musical
                    styles. Preparation involved not only technical and programming issues but extensive jamming. The
                    interactivity of Interactive Electronic Visualization Event was supplied during the day when the
                    audience could come and play with the equipment. Subsequently, the "I" was dropped, and
                    EVE2 and EVE3 continued as performances, which were interactive for the performers but not for the
                    audience.
                    EVE1 was the prototype, establishing the possibility of such an event. EVE2 (1975) involved a lot
                    more planning and quality control of content but was also held in the rotunda with live musical
                    accompaniment. EVE3, in 1977, still emphasized the real-time possibilities of this medium. However,
                    the performers felt that the logistics of organizing a complicated live performance and a
                    large-scale physical event were beginning to interfere with aesthetic goals. Therefore, the
                    performances were recorded in front of a small studio audience and were edited on a deck. The
                    finished show took place in the auditorium of the First National Bank, and the computer graphics and
                    sound were played back on a light-valve projector. By the end of the ''70s, calligraphic systems were
                    being replaced by raster graphics systems with framebuffering. Except in the video games industry,
                    computer graphics became very static. The possibility of interacting in real time with graphics is

                    NASA''s Jet Propulsion Lab and teach himself computer animation by producing his first film, First
                    Fig.

                    In 1975, John Whitney, Sr. invited Cuba to be the programmer on one of his films. The result of this
                    collaboration was Arabesque.

                    Subsequently, Cuba produced three more computer-animated films: 3/78 (Objects and Transformations),
                    Two Space, and Calculated Movements. These works were shown at film festivals throughout the
                    world---including Los Angeles, Hiroshima, Zagreb and Bangkok---and have won numerous awards. Cuba''s

                    Amsterdam Filmmuseum and the Isetan Museum of Art, Tokyo.

                    Cuba received grants for his work from the American Film Institute and The National Endowment for

                    In the pure form of abstraction that Cuba pursues, visual perception is paramount. But because the
                    images are generated via algorithms written in computer language, there is a paradox in trying to
                    use words to describe images for which words do not exist.

                    startups that predominate our industry, as a company in a totally different field in search of
                    solutions for which computer graphics was an excellent fit. Two real estate developers (Fred Daniels
                    and Mike Parker) building prefabricated houses for the Asian market were looking for ways to
                    communicate the complexities of assembling their product in the field in a clear, unambiguous way.
                    Because their product sold into a variety of countries speaking different languages, a visual
                    approach was ideal.
                    A video production group was formed, and the bold idea of harnassing computer graphics to
                    demonstrate the assembly of their product was adopted. In those days, there were no off-the-shelf
                    animation systems one could buy, and computers powerful enough to render were still in the $500,000
                    price range or higher.
                    By 1982, development had begun on a scanline polygon renderer written by Steve White from the
                    University of British Columbia. (Later, Steve became software architect for the Neo-Visuals
                    animation systemâ€”a turnkey computer animation system that debuted at SIGGRAPH 1985 and had the
                    interesting quality of being written in Fortan.) The computer was a VAX-11/750 that was "borrowed"
                    at night from a timeshare company two floors upstairs.
                    The company hired artists who had to learn computer graphics on the job. Very soon, the company
                    began work on computer animations for the Canada-wide market such as flying logos for national ad
                    campaigns, instructional videos, and a memorable 30-second flythough of Vancouver for a local radio
                    station. Time was billed at $1,000/second of finished work, and the upstairs computer with 4MB of
                    RAM was churning images on a nighly basis.
                    Vertigo employed many animators, many of whom are still active in the industry. Matt Arrott went on
                    to Silicon Graphics and later became Director of Engineering for Dreamworks. Rod Paul went to Rhythm
                    & Hues and then DreamWorks. Kirk McInroy ended up at ILM. Nancy St. John (producer) went on to
                    Digital Productions, ILM, and later worked on feature films such as Babe as an independent producer.
                    In 1983, Vertigo began development of a quadric surface constructive solid geometry renderer for its
                    producton work. The interesting thing here is that the developer on this project, Dave Gordon, went
                    on to Omnibus. (Later in 1988, the Omnibus software became the nucleus of the Side Effects animation
                    system.)

                    Berlin, Jr. to provide a turnkey computer animation system on an IBM personal computer. The Cubicomp
                    product, called PictureMaker, featured polygonal modeling, scene choreography, and rendering at a
                    much lower price point than on comparable workstation-based software systems. At the time of the
                    aquisition, the combined installed based totalled some 750 units worldwide.
                    Vertigo moved from the historic Pender Street office to a new modern office in the West End of
                    Vancouver. The team was reinvigorated by the new office, excitement, and owners and quickly got back
                    on track.
                    In 1988, the Vertigo product was rewritten to take advantage of the new RISC-based workstations from
                    SGI (the 4D series). All 3D modules of the system were integrated with new extended functionality
                    and enhanced workflow was provided. A new hardware product providing D1 and D2 video support, the
                    VideoPak (with development led by Dave Dignam), was released. Boolean modeling and ray tracing were
                    added in 1989. A notable advance for character animation purposes was the addition of free-form
                    deformations that permitted animatable lattice deformations to be applied to static or animated
                    objects. In addition to bend and twist deformations, the lattices also permitted arbitrary animation
                    of lattice points to enact simple muscle bulging.

                    of investors purchased the code. With little money and little experience, this team managed to
                    finish the next release of code, which sold well. Existing Vertigo users, fearing that this would be
                    the last cut, bought up the software. Surprised by its success, the team then continued to expand
                    and rebuilt the company. For a number of years the successes continued, as did the releases of
                    versions. New features were added, and the team grew back to the size it was in the early days. In
                    1993, the decision was make to ditch the old renderer in favor of supporting the industry standard
                    RenderMan. The team undertook this directly, creating a seamless link to RenderMan. An interface was
                    created to allow easy interactive editing of shaders and renders to RenderMan without writing out
                    the usual ASCII RIBs. Finally, this enabled Vertigo to break into the film market. Disney BVVE took
                    the system along with a great deal of support from Vertigo. This relationship grew into Vertigo
                    eventually producing shots for Disney movies in Vancouver. Even with this success and turning into a
                    public company, Vertigo again began to run short of cash and lost its capability to compete with
                    teams such as Softimage and Alias|Wavefront. In a final attempt to get out of the way of these
                    bigger competitors, the team started to move the entire development to the Mac using Apple
                    Quickdraw3D, at the same time spinning off smaller components into 2D applications such as Photoshop
                    and Illustrator. Vertigo still exists and still functions on the SGI.

                    West, David Seig engineered the VERSEFEX, a system in which full-color transparencies could be used
                    as input. Digital oscillators and 3D perspective were incorporated to animate the same video
                    parameters found in Scanimate. At Computer Image Corp., Ed Tajchman created the System IV, a true
                    digital 3D animation system with accurate perspective and digital keyframing. Its input, however,
                    was still monochrome video, and it carried a price tag of around a million dollars. The System IV
                    was used in production (by this author) at Editel in Hollywood from 1983 to 1985 in conjunction with
                    Scanimate.

                    The aesthetics of television graphics were driven by analog technology in the 1970s and early ''80s,
                    and were defined by such Scanimate effects as shining gold logos flying over glowing grids and
                    sparkling star fields. Because Scanimate used a video CRT, optical devices such as star filters,
                    shower glass, or rainbow filters could be placed in front of the lens to make the logos glow or
                    twinkle.
                    A Scanimate suite was much like a video-editing suite; image sources were combined through a video
                    switcher using wipes, cross-dissolves, luminance keying, and chroma keying. Multiple images could be
                    played back from multiple videotape machines through the switcher. Scanimate could be triggered to
                    run in sync with any tape deck. (This was before the invention of VHS, Beta, or digital videotape.
                    The professional video standard format at this time was reel-to-reel two-inch videotape!) Scanimate
                    animation could be recorded on one tape machine, played back with another pass added on top, and
                    then recorded to another machine.
                    These video techniques enabled Scanimate trickery to be used, for example, to create 3D gold flying
                    logos. Here''s the secret: An artist programmed Scanimate to create an undulating golden texture
                    using oscillators patched into the INTENSITY parameter. (At Image West, we referred to this effect
                    as "Thrill-o-vision!") A 3D logo, physically carved from balsa wood, was attached to a
                    wooden dowel and connected to a stepper motor. The front surface of the carved logo was painted
                    white, and the extruded sides were painted gray. The whole logo was then mounted in front of a
                    chroma key blue background. Patching these signals into the video switcher, the artist defined the
                    logo''s white front surface as a luminance key hole. He then replaced it with the moving gold texture
                    from Scanimate. Setting a different luminance key for the gray surfaces, he patched a darker gold
                    texture into the extruded sides. He then created a streaking Scanimate star field and replaced the
                    chroma key blue with that. The artist added another Scanimate pass to make the logo glow and used an
                    Apple II computer to drive the motor to rotate the logo. VoilÃ¡! A 3D gold logo rotating through
                    space! All this was recorded to tape in real time with the capability to change speeds, color, or
                    motion as the client and art director supervised.
